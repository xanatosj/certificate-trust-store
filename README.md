# Deploying CA Certificates

## Why is this needed? 
Applications are not typically aware of upstream devices/services that perform SSL/TLS decryption of traffic. When a connection attempt is made and the device/application is unaware of this certificate, it doesnâ€™t allow for the secure handshake to complete.  Updating the trusted certificate store for the application removes the requirement for either removing the traffic from the scope of decryption and/or instructing tools to bypass certificate validation for secure connections.

## Creating a certificate bundle

To create a certificate bundle that includes both the public Certificate Authorities and the corporate Certificate authority. 

* Download the certificate bundle from [https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem) 

* Append the Root CA Certificate(s) to the cacert.pem file that you downloaded. It is recommended to save this as a new file name: ```ca-cert-bundle.pem```. 

## Disclaimer
This document is subject to change due to applications changing the ways they potentially use certificates.

<summary>PHP</summary>
 
Inside php.ini specify path to the certs.  Create the following entry:
> openssl.cafile=/path/to/cacert.pem

_Restart of web services may be needed_

<summary>Python</summary> 
Use one of the following methods for Python via PIP.

 <summary> Adding the custom certificate</summary>
<details>
<summary>MacOS/Linux</summary>

1) Create a directory to host the CA Cert Bundle.  Move the cert bundle to that location
> mkdir ~/ca_certs
> mv ~/Downloads/custom-ca-bundle.pem ~/ca_certs
2) Add cert bundle to python to trust the cert chain

> pip config set global.cert ~/ca_certs
</details>
<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>
 
1) Create a new directory and move the bundle to C:\ drive.
 
2) Add certificate bundle to python trust store (command below via Powershell)
> mv $env:HOMEPATH\Downloads\custom-ca-bundle.pem $env:APPDATA

> pip config set global.cert $env:APPDATA\custom-ca-bundle.pem 
</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Set via the environment variables</summary>
Run the following commands to set the SSL_CERT_FILE option to use the (downloaded) cert bundle
 
> export CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/SSLDecrypt.pem
> 
> export CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/certs/
> 
> export SSL_CERT_FILE=${CERT_PATH}
> 
> export SSL_CERT_DIR=${CERT_DIR}
> 
> export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${CERT_PATH}
