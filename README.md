# Deploying CA Certificates

## Why is this needed? 
Applications are not typically aware of upstream devices/services that perform SSL/TLS decryption of traffic. When a connection attempt is made and the device/application is unaware of this certificate, it doesnâ€™t allow for the secure handshake to complete.  Updating the trusted certificate store for the application removes the requirement for either removing the traffic from the scope of decryption and/or instructing tools to bypass certificate validation for secure connections.

## Assumption
* The Root CA is already available in base64 format (pem).
* All traffic is tunneled through the solution that is performing decryption. (i.e. no SSL/TLS decryption exclusions)
* To get a cacert.pem bundle, you can download it from here https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem 

## Disclaimer
This document is subject to change due to applications changing the ways they potentially use certificates.

<details>
<summary>cURL</summary>
Create a certificate bundle that includes the Root CA certificate and the public Certificate Authorities

Set cacert config option

> echo "cacert=/path/to/ca-cert-bundle.pem" >> $HOME/.curlrc

Set CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable

> echo "export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/ca-cert-bundle.pem" >> $HOME/.bashrc

Set SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable

> echo "export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/ca-cert-bundle.pem" >> $HOME/.bashrc

</details>


<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>
When building containers within docker, we need to copy the certificate into the container and into the appropriate location. 

> \# Previous Dockerfile lines \
> \# Add the Root CA Certificate to the container \
> ADD ca-cert-bundle.pem /tmp/ca-cert-bundle.pem \
> \# Find the location of the certificate directory. Copy the ca-cert-bundle.pem file into this directory. Run update-ca-certificates. \ 
> RUN CERT_DIR=(openssl version -d | cut -f2 -d \")/certs ; cp /tmp/ca-cert-bundle.pem $CERT_DIR ; update-ca-certificates ; \
> \# More Dockerfile lines \

<summary>Firefox (Mozilla)</summary>
Configure Mozilla Firefox to use the Windows root certificate store.

* In the browser, type "about:config" in the browser.  When the caution prompt appears, select Accept the Risk and Continue.
> about:config
* In the config search bar, type "security.enterprise_roots.enabled".  Change the option from False to True
> security.enterprise_roots.enabled

[Java](https://github.com/xanatosj/certificate-trust-store/blob/main/Java/Java.md)


<details>
<summary>npm</summary>
 
1) Create a PEM file containing the root and intermediate certificates

2) Run npm command, setting the cafile
> npm config set cafile path/of/ca-bundle.pem
</details>

<details>
<summary>PHP</summary>
 
Inside php.ini specify path to the certs.  Create the following entry:
> openssl.cafile=/path/to/cacert.pem

_Restart of web services may be needed_

<details>
<summary>Python</summary> 
Use one of the following methods for Python via PIP.
<details>
 <summary> Adding the custom certificate</summary>
<details>
<summary>MacOS/Linux</summary>

1) Create a directory to host the CA Cert Bundle.  Move the cert bundle to that location
> mkdir ~/ca_certs
> mv ~/Downloads/custom-ca-bundle.pem ~/ca_certs
2) Add cert bundle to python to trust the cert chain

> pip config set global.cert ~/ca_certs
</details>
<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>
 
1) Create a new directory and move the bundle to C:\ drive.
 
2) Add certificate bundle to python trust store (command below via Powershell)
> mv $env:HOMEPATH\Downloads\custom-ca-bundle.pem $env:APPDATA

> pip config set global.cert $env:APPDATA\custom-ca-bundle.pem 
</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Set via the environment variables</summary>
Run the following commands to set the SSL_CERT_FILE option to use the (downloaded) cert bundle
 
> export CERT_PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/SSLDecrypt.pem
> 
> export CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/certs/
> 
> export SSL_CERT_FILE=${CERT_PATH}
> 
> export SSL_CERT_DIR=${CERT_DIR}
> 
> export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${CERT_PATH} 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Rust (Linux)</summary>
Use Rust to add the decryption root ca to the Linux Trust store

1) Place root certificate(s) in the following directory
> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
2) Update the CA store via CLI.  Note - Sudo permissions required

 > sudo update-ca-certificates

<details>
<summary>Snowflake ODBC Driver</summary>
Snowflake can be configured to connect to the data warehouse over https; to allow this via proxy, replace the PEM file under C:\Program Files\Snowflake ODBC Driver\etc with your custom CA PEM file.

> C:\Program Files\Snowflake ODBC Driver\etc

* If the JRE directory is not present, use the JBR directory instead (Android Studio Version dependant).
* Ensure that you specify the full path to the Android Studio Keystore.

<summary>VSCode</summary>
 
By default VSCode does not use the built-in certificate store (Windows) or the System Keychain (macOS); VSCode needs to have a plugin installed to instruct it to use the certificate store (Windows), or System Keychain (macOS)


_**macOS**_

This is a custom plugin at the VSCode Marketplace - [Mac CA VSCode - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=linhmtran168.mac-ca-vscode)

_**Windows**_

This is a custom plugin at the VSCode Marketplace - [win-ca - Visual Studio Marketplace ] (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ukoloff.win-ca)
