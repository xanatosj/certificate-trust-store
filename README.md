# Deploying CA Certificates to Applications

## Why is this needed? 
Applications are not typically aware of upstream devices/services that perform SSL/TLS decryption of traffic. When a connection attempt is made and the device/application is unaware of this certificate, it doesnâ€™t allow for the secure handshake to complete.  Updating the trusted certificate store for the application removes the requirement for either removing the traffic from the scope of decryption and/or instructing tools to bypass certificate validation for secure connections.

## Creating a certificate bundle

To create a certificate bundle that includes both the public Certificate Authorities and the corporate Certificate authority. 

* Download the certificate bundle from [https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem) 

* Append the Root CA Certificate(s) to the cacert.pem file that you downloaded. It is recommended to save this as a new file name: ```ca-cert-bundle.pem```. 

## Disclaimer
This document is subject to change due to applications changing the ways they potentially use certificates.
