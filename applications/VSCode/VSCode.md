# VSCode

By default VSCode does not use the built-in certificate store (Windows) or the System Keychain (macOS); VSCode needs to have a plugin installed to instruct it to use the certificate store (Windows), or System Keychain (macOS)

**macOS**

This is a custom plugin at the VSCode Marketplace - [Mac CA VSCode - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=linhmtran168.mac-ca-vscode)

**Windows**

This is a custom plugin at the VSCode Marketplace - [win-ca - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ukoloff.win-ca)
